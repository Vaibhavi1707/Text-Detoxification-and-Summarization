the BERT model is the tensor **logits**. After passing the input-encoding into the BERT model and training the model, the tensor logits is obtained simply by specifying output.logits. And then, a SoftMax activation function is finally applied to the logits. By applying a **SoftMax** onto the output of BERT, probabilistic distributions for each of the words in BERT’s vocabulary are obtained for replacing the mask token. Words with a higher probability value will be better candidate replacement words for the mask token. However, despite using class-specific sentence embeddings, BERT often predicts toxic words, apparently paying more attention to the context than to the embeddings of the desired class. And so, to force the model to generate non-toxic words, the toxicity of each token in BERT vocabulary is calculated and is used to penalize the predicted probabilities. \n","\n","In order to get the tensor of SoftMax values of all the words in BERT’s vocabulary, one can get the masked token index using torch.where(). The torch.topk() function, which allows one to retrieve the top k values in a given tensor, and returns a tensor containing the top k values, is iterated through, and the mask token in the sentence is replaced with the candidate tokens. Instead of using torch.topk() for retrieving the top l values, torch.argmax(), which returns the index of the maximum value in the tensor, can also be used."],"metadata":{"id":"LJzXWPgDG_-4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["max_word_toxicity = np.max(wordtoxicities_df.toxicity.tolist())\n","min_word_toxicity = np.min(wordtoxicities_df.toxicity.tolist())\n","\n","#toxic comment\n","\n","unmasked = \"Your [MASK] is your [MASK]!\";\n","masked = tokenizer.encode(unmasked, return_tensors = 'pt')[0] \n","\n","comment = []\n","for token in masked:\n","    comment.append(''.join(tokenizer.decode(token).split()))\n","\n","#retrieving detoxified comment\n","\n","mask_token_indices = torch.where(masked == tokenizer.mask_token_id)[0]\n","\n","token_logits = outputs.logits\n","\n","softy = func.softmax(token_logits, dim = -1)\n","mask_token_logits = softy[0, mask_token_indices, :]\n","\n","for i in range(len(mask_token_indices.tolist())):\n","    top_ten_tokens = torch.topk(mask_token_logits, 10, dim = 1, sorted = True).indices[i].tolist()\n","    \n","    #before rescoring on the basis of toxicities\n","    for token in top_ten_tokens:\n","        comment[mask_token_indices[i]] = tokenizer.decode(token)\n","        print(comment)\n","\n","    print()\n","    \n","    mask_tokens =  torch.sort(mask_token_logits, dim = 1, stable = True).indices[i].tolist()\n","    token_logits = torch.sort(mask_token_logits, dim = 1, stable = True).values[i].tolist()\n","        \n","    better_mask_tokens = []\n","    better_mask_token_logits = []\n","    for j in range(len(token_logits)):\n","        better_mask_tokens.append(mask_tokens[j])\n","\n","        token = ''.join(tokenizer.decode(mask_tokens[j]).split())\n","        if token in wordtoxicities_dict:\n","            better_mask_token_logits.append(token_logits[j] / (max_word_toxicity -
